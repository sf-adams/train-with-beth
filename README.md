<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Background

This project came about after discussions with a personal trainer from Surrey, United Kingdom. Mostly instagram-based, **Train With Beth** had the potential to expand to the web.

It is now a web-based application, with endless opportunities for expansion. The goal of the project is to promote Beth, as well as help to expand her range of services.

There is a roadmap below to see all the features that will hopefully be added to this project in the future.
